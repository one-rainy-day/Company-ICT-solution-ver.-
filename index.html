                                        They are usually contained within an executable file.

                <p>A data breach is a security incident in which information is accessed without authorization.
                    Data breaches can hurt businesses and consumers in a variety of ways.
                    They are a costly expense that can damage lives and reputations and take time to repair.</p>

                <p>As technology progresses, more and more of our information has been moving to the digital world.
                    As a result, cyberattacks have become increasingly common and costly.
                    We’ve created a <b>7-step checklist</b> to use in the case of a data breach.
                    Depending on the severity of the breach and the information exposed,
                    you’ll need to apply some or all of these steps to varying degree. </p><br>

                        <h3>1. Confirm the breach and if your information was exposed</h3>
                        <p>The first step is to confirm that a breach actually occurred.
                            When a data breach occurs, scammers may reach out to you posing as the breached company
                            to try to obtain more of your personal information.
                            Don't fall for fake emails. Go to the company's secure website and/or call the company
                            to confirm the breach and whether your information was involved.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="step2" class="tab-pane fade">
                        <h3>2. Find out what type of data was stolen</h3>
                        <p>Why does the type of information exposed matter?
                            While stolen credit cards and the like can be cancelled and replaced,
                            it's quite difficult to obtain a new Social Security number.
                            And fraudsters can do a lot more with your SSN and other unique,
                            sensitive PII than they can accomplish with an email or credit card account.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="step3" class="tab-pane fade">
                        <h3>3. Accept the breached company's offer(s) to help</h3>
                        <p>If the breached company offers to help repair the damage and protect you for a certain
                            amount of time, unless there have been issues with their offer, take them up on it.
                            For example, after its 2017 breach, the credit reporting agency offered credit
                            file monitoring and identity theft protection.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="step4" class="tab-pane fade">
                        <h3>4. Change Password and Security Q&A</h3>
                        <p>It's important to immediately change your online login information, passwords,
                            and security questions-and-answers for the breached account(s)-along with your other
                            accounts if they have similar passwords and security Q&A-to limit the reach of the hackers'
                            arms.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="step5" class="tab-pane fade">
                        <h3>5. Contact the right people and take additional action</h3>
                        <p>This is where the type of data stolen really comes into play.
                            If your credit and/or debit card information was stolen,
                            as it was in the big-box retailer's data breach, you should reach out immediately
                            to your financial institution(s) to cancel your card and request a new one.</p>
                        <p>However, if more sensitive personal information like your Social Security number was stolen,
                            as it was in the credit reporting agency's breach, you could potentially more easily
                            become a victim of identity theft or fraud. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="step6" class="tab-pane fade">
                        <h3>6. Stay alert; monitor your accounts closely</h3>
                        <p>It's important to stay alert and watch for signs of new activity.
                            For example, in cases where Social Security numbers were stolen,
                            the hackers and others who put their hands on the numbers may use them now-or wait
                            years for a time when victims may be less likely on alert.
                            That's why it's important to follow the breach-related steps noted in number 5
                            above when your Social Security number is exposed.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="step7" class="tab-pane fade">
                        <h3>7. Be Alert and at the Ready</h3>
                        <p>In the wake of a data breach, remember that the breach alone doesn't mean you're
                            immediately a victim. But if sensitive data like Social Security numbers are stolen,
                            you could potentially become a victim down the road. Unlike credit card numbers,
                            you can't easily change your Social Security number, so the identity theft risk
                            remains.</p>
                        <p>The important thing is to stay alert and know what to look for,
                            even as you strive to keep your personal information as secure as possible.
                            If you do see red flags, be ready to take the appropriate actions we've outlined
                            to help protect yourself.</p>
